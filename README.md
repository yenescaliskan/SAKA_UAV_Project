# SAKA_UAV_Project
It is the UAV project designed for the TÜBİTAK International Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Competition 2021. Within the scope of the competition, we were asked to design a rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle that can autonomously follow a certain route and take water from a pool whose coordinates are given and release the water to a red area determined by image processing.
